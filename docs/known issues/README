adspygoogle - SOLVED
===========

This library has so many issues when you wanna install it on Windows.

When we exec pip install adspygoogle, it will install some dependencies like pyxml and celementtree, but i have no F****CKING ideia why, this shit returns always the same error of gcc compiling.

So use the adspygoogle-1.1.4.tar.gz like:

python setup.py install --no_PyXML --no_cElementTree

    SOLUTION
    ========

    Remove adspygoogle

    pip uninstall adspygoogle

    Install new package googleads

    pip install googleads
